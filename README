Knight Fight is a 2D isometric game for iPhone and iPad, written using Cocos2D.

I have uploaded a video of the game being played to YouTube

I created the game as an assignment for a Games Programming course, which I took as part of my MSc. Older coders among you may recognise that the gameplay is a nod to Gunfright, a superb game published by Utlimate in 1986.
